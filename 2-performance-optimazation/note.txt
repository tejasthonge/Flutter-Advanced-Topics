Performance- 

this is very important parameter of app developmentfiled 

#following are different types basic methodologies to optimize the performance of our app


##1Tracing:

    in this we are traking which program or function or task take consumes the 
    how mush oc time


    void myConsumtion(){
        Timeline.starSync("myConsumtion");

        //work code

        Timeline.finishSync();
    }  


##2FlameChart:

    -it is an graphical representation of the time required to build any widget or complite some fun. or the method 
    Flame Chart Structure:
        Horizontal Length: Represents the time spent in a function or process.
        Vertical Stacking: Indicates function call depth; nested calls appear above their callers.
        Colors: Often, different colors represent different threads, functions, or types of events.



##3Trade-off:
    * Performance vs. Readability: Highly optimized code may be hard to read and maintain.
    * Memory vs. Processing Time: Using more memory (like caching) can reduce computational overhead, but it increases memory usage.
    * Consistency vs. Availability: In distributed systems, you often need to choose between having consistent data or having the system always available.
    * In practice, you should weigh these trade-offs based on the specific needs of your project or system. Would you like to dive deeper into any of these trade-offs?


##4Tools -Basics:
    Profile and Debug mode:
        -by defoult debug mode is much slover as comper to profile mode or the production mode 


    #1 Avoide work on UI Thread
    
    #2Minimum use of expensive Widgets
    
    #3Track The Widgets builds
    
    #4DartDev Tools
    
    #5Observatory


Note: 
    - for the logical time or the time cusming optetion create new isolate and run on it like bellow 


-->
floowing is the basic code of it 

import "dart:developer";
import "dart:isolate";

import "package:flutter/material.dart";
import "package:lottie/lottie.dart";

//In dart only one thread is present 
//but in other programing languages when block the one thread then the to perfom te the other opretions they uses the other thred known as muilty threading 
//but in dart thire are other concept known as isolate 

void main(){

  runApp(MyApp());
}

                              //gif view is just for undstand the what is hoppening when we call any complex tastk

              //dou of that comlex task ui is bolocked to avid this we can use another isolate to perofom the these complex task
